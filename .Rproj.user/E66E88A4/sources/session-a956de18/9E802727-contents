Hello there! I am currently a PhD student in the Sociology Department at Brown University. I am broadly interested in the areas of Inequality, Work and Organization, Demography, Social Policy, and Applied Statistics. I am passionate about using quantitative data to examine and answer questions pertinent to my research interests. I hope that my work can contribute to fostering a society that is not only more equal and equitable but also more inclusive and diverse. I hold a Bachelor's degree with first-class honours in Social Sciences with Quantitative Methods from University College London and a Master's degree in Social Statistics from London School of Economics and Political Science. Prior to joining Brown Sociology, I completed my pre-doctoral fellowship with Prof. Emma Zang at Yale University.

Outside of academics, I enjoy listening to music, visiting museums, biking through the countryside, and reading the New York Times.
